                  calculated based on the amount of work completed and any costs
                  incurred.

              <p>
                Web briks, LLC includes a specified number of revisions in the
                scope of each service, as outlined in the project agreement. Our
                aim is to satisfy clients. So revisions will continue until the
                client approves the project. Once the project approves, we may
                incur extra charges for further modifications. We strive to
                complete modifications within a reasonable turnaround time,
                typically 3-5 business days. It depends on the complexity of the
                changes and project workload. All modifications must be
                requested in writing and will be handled promptly to ensure
                client satisfaction.
